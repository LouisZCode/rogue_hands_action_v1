# Rogue Hands 2.5D - Code Improvements Log
*Zero breakage approach - Test after every phase*

## üìñ **ABOUT THIS LOG**

### **Purpose**
This log tracks a systematic code refactoring project for the Rogue Hands 2.5D game, focusing on improving code organization and maintainability while ensuring **zero gameplay changes**. The project uses an incremental, test-after-every-phase approach to maintain stability.

### **Key Principles**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Zero Gameplay Impact**: All improvements preserve exact game behavior 
- üîÑ **Test After Every Phase**: Each phase is tested before proceeding
- üìä **CSV Workflow Preservation**: Enemy data system and Excel‚ÜíCSV‚ÜíGame workflow completely unchanged
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk-Aware Progression**: Phases are ordered from lowest to highest risk

### **How to Use This Log**
