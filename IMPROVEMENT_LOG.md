# Rogue Hands 2.5D - Code Improvements Log
*Zero breakage approach - Test after every phase*

## 🛡️ SAFETY-FIRST STRATEGY
- **✅ SAFE PAUSE POINTS**: Game works perfectly, test freely
- **⚠️ CAREFUL TESTING**: Small changes, test immediately  
- **🔄 PAUSE & TEST**: Stop after every phase for user approval

## ✅ **PHASE 1: CONSTANTS EXTRACTION COMPLETE** ✅ **SAFE PAUSE POINT**
**Started**: 2025-06-26  
**Completed**: 2025-06-26  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Risk Level**: ✅ Zero Risk - Only replacing numbers with named constants

### What's Being Changed:
- **Before**: Magic numbers scattered throughout code (`speed: float = 200.0`, `dash_speed: float = 600.0`)
- **After**: Organized constants in `GameConstants.gd` (`speed: float = GameConstants.PLAYER_SPEED`)

### What Stays EXACTLY The Same:
- ✅ All CSV data and enemy loading system
- ✅ All enemy behavior and AI patterns  
- ✅ All combat calculations and damage values
- ✅ All movement speeds and timing
- ✅ All audio triggers and visual effects
- ✅ Excel → CSV → Game workflow completely preserved

### Files Created:
1. ✅ `Scripts/GameConstants.gd` - Centralized game constants

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `Scripts/Player.gd` - Replace hardcoded values with constants
2. 🔄 `Scripts/Enemy.gd` - Replace hardcoded values with constants

### Changes Made:

#### GameConstants.gd
- **Created**: Central constants file following Godot 4.4 best practices
- **Organization**: Constants grouped by category (Movement, Combat, AI, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Replace magic numbers with meaningful names

#### Player.gd Changes:
- **Movement Constants**: 
  - `speed: float = 200.0` → `speed: float = GameConstants.PLAYER_SPEED`
  - `dash_speed: float = 600.0` → `dash_speed: float = GameConstants.PLAYER_DASH_SPEED`
  - `dash_duration: float = 0.3` → `dash_duration: float = GameConstants.PLAYER_DASH_DURATION`
  - `acceleration: float = 800.0` → `acceleration: float = GameConstants.PLAYER_ACCELERATION`
  - `deceleration: float = 1000.0` → `deceleration: float = GameConstants.PLAYER_DECELERATION`
- **Combat Constants**: 
  - `attack_cooldown: float = 1.0` → `attack_cooldown: float = GameConstants.ATTACK_COOLDOWN`
  - `immunity_duration: float = 0.5` → `immunity_duration: float = GameConstants.IMMUNITY_DURATION`
  - `stun_duration: float = 3.0` → `stun_duration: float = GameConstants.STUN_DURATION`
  - `parry_window_duration: float = 0.5` → `parry_window_duration: float = GameConstants.PARRY_WINDOW_DURATION`
- **Health & Defense Constants**:
  - `max_health: int = 5` → `max_health: int = GameConstants.PLAYER_MAX_HEALTH`
  - `max_defense_points: int = 3` → `max_defense_points: int = GameConstants.PLAYER_MAX_DEFENSE_POINTS`
- **Animation & Timing Constants**:
  - `movement_threshold: float = 10.0` → `movement_threshold: float = GameConstants.MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD`
  - `long_idle_delay: float = 5.0` → `long_idle_delay: float = GameConstants.LONG_IDLE_DELAY`
  - `stance_rotation_speed: float = 0.15` → `stance_rotation_speed: float = GameConstants.STANCE_ROTATION_SPEED`
- **Physics Constants**:
  - Separation distance `30.0` → `GameConstants.SEPARATION_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD`
  - Player separation force `50.0` → `GameConstants.PLAYER_SEPARATION_FORCE`
- **Screen Shake Constants**:
  - All hardcoded screen shake values → `GameConstants.SCREEN_SHAKE_*` constants
- **Timing Constants**:
  - Rotation tween duration `0.2` → `GameConstants.ROTATION_TWEEN_DURATION`

### 🧪 Test Checklist for Phase 1:
- [x] Player movement feels identical ✅ **PASSED**
- [x] Enemy AI behaves the same ✅ **PASSED**
- [x] CSV enemy spawning (keys 1-8) works ✅ **PASSED**
- [x] Combat damage values unchanged ✅ **PASSED**
- [x] Audio triggers at same times ✅ **PASSED**
- [x] All 8 enemy types from CSV work correctly ✅ **PASSED**
- [x] Excel workflow: CSV edit → game reflection works ✅ **PASSED**

**✅ Phase 1A COMPLETE: Player.gd constants extraction - ALL TESTS PASSED!**

**✅ Phase 1B COMPLETE: Enemy.gd constants extraction - ALL TESTS PASSED!**
- All hardcoded constants replaced with GameConstants references
- CSV data loading system completely preserved
- ✅ **TESTING COMPLETE**: All enemy behavior identical, CSV workflow preserved

### What's Being Changed:
- **Before**: Magic numbers scattered throughout Enemy.gd (`speed: float = 100.0`, `detection_range: float = 150.0`)
- **After**: Organized constants from `GameConstants.gd` (`speed: float = GameConstants.ENEMY_SPEED`)

### What Stays EXACTLY The Same:
- ✅ **ALL CSV-driven values preserved** - Enemy data loading completely unchanged
- ✅ All enemy behavior and AI patterns identical
- ✅ All 8 enemy types from CSV work exactly the same
- ✅ All combat calculations and damage values preserved
- ✅ All movement speeds and timing (CSV values override defaults)
- ✅ Excel → CSV → Game workflow completely preserved

#### Enemy.gd Changes Complete:
✅ **Successfully updated Enemy.gd with GameConstants references:**
- **Movement Constants**: All speed, acceleration, and movement thresholds now use GameConstants
- **Detection Constants**: Base detection radius and attack range use GameConstants  
- **AI Timing Constants**: Stance decision timer, retreat timer use GameConstants
- **Physics Constants**: Separation distance and force values use GameConstants
- **Boundary Constants**: Level boundary checks now use GameConstants values
- **All CSV-driven values preserved**: Enemy data loading system completely unchanged

## ✅ **PHASE 2: COMBAT SYSTEM UNIFICATION** ✅ **SAFE PAUSE POINT**
**Started**: 2025-06-26  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  
**Risk Level**: ✅ Zero Risk - Only centralizing duplicate combat logic

### What's Being Changed:
- **Before**: Combat calculations duplicated between Player.gd and Enemy.gd
- **After**: Centralized combat system in `CombatCalculator.gd`

### What Stays EXACTLY The Same:
- ✅ All damage values and combat results identical
- ✅ All CSV enemy data and behavior preserved
- ✅ All rock-paper-scissors logic unchanged
- ✅ All parry mechanics and timing preserved
- ✅ Excel → CSV → Game workflow completely preserved

### Files Created:
1. 🔄 `Scripts/CombatCalculator.gd` - Centralized combat calculations

### Files Modified:
1. 🔄 `Scripts/Player.gd` - Use CombatCalculator for damage calculations
2. 🔄 `Scripts/Enemy.gd` - Use CombatCalculator for damage calculations
