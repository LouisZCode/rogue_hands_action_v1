# Combat Balancing Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

This document details the four combat balancing mechanics that were implemented to improve the game's balance and user experience.

### 1. Auto-Return to Neutral After Dash Attack
**File:** `/Scripts/Player.gd`
**Location:** `handle_movement()` function, lines 70-74

- **What:** Player automatically returns to neutral stance when dash attack completes
- **Why:** Prevents players from staying in vulnerable attack stances indefinitely
- **Implementation:** Added `change_stance(Stance.NEUTRAL)` when `dash_timer` reaches 0

### 2. Increased Attack Cooldown (1 Second)
**File:** `/Scripts/Player.gd`
**Location:** Line 21

- **What:** Attack cooldown increased from 0.3 seconds to 1.0 seconds
- **Why:** Prevents spam-clicking attacks and adds strategic timing
- **Implementation:** Changed `@export var attack_cooldown: float = 1.0`

### 3. UI Cooldown Bar and Feedback
**Files:** 
- `/scenes/main.tscn` (lines 139-165)
- `/Scripts/GameManager.gd` (multiple locations)
- `/Scripts/Player.gd` (line 47, 59-60)

- **What:** Visual progress bar showing attack cooldown status
- **Components:**
  - Progress bar that fills from red (cooling down) to green (ready)
  - Label showing "Attack Ready" or "Cooldown: X.Xs"
  - Real-time updates during gameplay
- **Implementation:**
  - Added `AttackCooldownBar` and `CooldownLabel` UI elements
  - Added `attack_cooldown_changed` signal to Player
  - Added `update_attack_cooldown_ui()` function to GameManager

### 4. Proper Rock-Paper-Scissors Damage Logic
**File:** `/Scripts/Enemy.gd`
**Location:** `calculate_combat_damage()` and `take_damage_from_player()` functions

- **What:** Fixed and clarified RPS combat logic
- **Rules Implemented:**
  - **Paper beats Rock:** 30 damage (Player wins)
  - **Rock beats Scissors:** 30 damage (varies by context)
  - **Same stance (Tie):** 10 damage
  - **Losing matchup:** 5 damage (reduced damage)
- **Improvements:**
  - Clearer logic flow and comments
  - Better debug output showing exact matchups
  - Consistent damage values across all combat scenarios

## Technical Details

### Signal Flow
1. Player performs attack → `attack_cooldown_timer` starts counting down
2. Every frame during cooldown → Player emits `attack_cooldown_changed` signal
3. GameManager receives signal → Updates UI elements with current cooldown status

### UI Layout
- **Health Bar:** Bottom-left corner (unchanged)
- **Stance Indicator:** Bottom-right corner (unchanged)
- **Cooldown Bar:** Bottom-center (new)
- **Cooldown Label:** Above cooldown bar (new)

### Combat Balance Impact
- **Tactical Timing:** 1-second cooldown encourages strategic attack timing
- **Risk/Reward:** Auto-return to neutral forces players to reposition after attacks
- **Visual Feedback:** Cooldown bar provides clear information for decision-making
- **Fair Combat:** Proper RPS logic ensures predictable and balanced outcomes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Cooldown Timing:** Verify attacks cannot be performed during cooldown
2. **Auto-Return:** Confirm player returns to neutral after each dash attack
3. **UI Updates:** Check cooldown bar updates smoothly and accurately
4. **RPS Logic:** Test all stance combinations for correct damage values:
   - Player Paper vs Enemy Rock = 30 damage to enemy
   - Player Rock vs Enemy Rock = 10 damage to enemy  
   - Player Scissors vs Enemy Rock = 5 damage to enemy

## Files Modified

1. `/Scripts/Player.gd` - Core combat mechanics and signals
2. `/Scripts/Enemy.gd` - Combat damage calculations
3. `/Scripts/GameManager.gd` - UI management and signal handling
4. `/scenes/main.tscn` - UI element additions

All changes maintain backward compatibility and integrate seamlessly with existing game systems.
