# Combat Logic System

## Core Combat Mechanics

This document defines the complete combat system for Rogue Hands, including damage calculation, defense points, parry system, and stun mechanics.

## Health & Defense Systems

### Health Points
- **Player**: 5 HP (displayed as hearts ‚ù§Ô∏èüíî)
- **Enemy**: 5 HP (health bar display)

### Defense Points
- **Player**: 3 Defense Points (displayed as shields üõ°Ô∏èüíî)
- **Enemy**: 1 Defense Point (displayed as shield emoji)
- **Usage**: Consumed when defending with same stance as incoming attack
- **Effect**: Blocks damage but reduces defense points by 1
- **Visual Feedback**: Blue circles around player that expand and fade when consumed

## Parry System

### Perfect Parry Window
- **Duration**: 0.5 seconds after entering a combat stance
- **Visual Indicator**: Green circle that fades over the parry window duration
- **Trigger**: Entering Rock, Paper, or Scissors stance
- **Effect**: If attacked during this window with a losing attack, executes perfect parry

### Perfect Parry Benefits
- **Damage**: 0 damage to defender
- **Stun**: Attacker becomes stunned for 3 seconds
- **Visual Feedback**: Gold flash on parry circle, screen shake, perfect parry sound
- **Tactical**: Rewards precise timing and stance prediction

## Combat Scenarios

The combat system recognizes two distinct scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Attack vs Defense
**Situation**: One character attacks (dashing), other is in stance but not dashing

**Damage Rules**:
1. **vs Neutral Stance**: 1 damage (reduced by neutral stance defense)
2. **Perfect Parry**: 0 damage, attacker stunned (within 0.5s parry window)
3. **Regular Block**: 0 damage, defender loses 1 defense point (outside parry window)
4. **Same Stance Defense**: 
   - With defense points: 0 damage, defender loses 1 defense point
   - Without defense points: 1 damage (balanced tie damage)
5. **Win (attacker stronger stance)**: 2 damage

### Scenario 2: Mutual Attacks
**Situation**: Both characters dashing/attacking simultaneously

**Damage Rules**:
1. **Different winning stances**: Winner deals 2 damage, loser becomes stunned
2. **Same stances (tie)**: 0 damage to both, no stun
3. **Note**: Parry window not applicable (both are attacking)

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Rules

**Winning Matchups**:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper

## Stun System

### Stun Triggers
- **Perfect Parry**: Attacking into a perfect parry window
- **Mutual Attack Loss**: Losing stance matchup in mutual attacks
- **Duration**: 3 seconds for both player and enemy

### Stun Effects
- Character cannot move or change stances
- Auto-return to neutral stance
- Visual indicator (üí´) shows stunned state
- Purple color tint during stun
- Auto-recovery after timer expires
- Cancels any ongoing dashes

## Defense Point System

### Consumption
- Used only when defending with same stance as incoming attack
- Prevents damage but costs 1 defense point
- When depleted: same-stance defense fails (takes damage instead)

### Regeneration
- **Current**: No regeneration (fixed resource per battle)
- **Future**: Regeneration mechanics to be considered during balancing

## Tactical Implications

### Resource Management
- Defense points create strategic resource to manage
- Players must decide when to use defense vs dodge/reposition

### Timing Strategy
- Mutual attacks create high-risk, high-reward scenarios
- Stun punishment encourages careful stance selection

### Positioning
- Neutral stance remains safe but limits offensive options
- Combat stances enable attacks but create vulnerability windows

### Parry Timing
- Perfect parry window rewards precise stance prediction
- Risk vs reward: enter stance early for parry opportunity
- Defensive circles show current defense resources

## User Interface

### Health Display
- **Hearts**: ‚ù§Ô∏è for current health, üíî for missing health
- **Location**: Top-left corner
- **Dynamic**: Scales based on max health

### Defense Points Display  
- **Shields**: üõ°Ô∏è for active defense, üíî for consumed defense
- **Location**: Below hearts (top-left)
- **Visual Circles**: Blue concentric circles around player during combat stances

### Attack Cooldown
- **Progress Bar**: Below player character
- **Visibility**: Only shown while charging (1 second cooldown)
- **Color**: Red while charging, green when ready

### Stance Indicator
- **Location**: Bottom-right corner
- **Display**: Current stance with emoji and color coding
- **Colors**: Blue (Neutral), Gray (Rock), White (Paper), Yellow (Scissors)

### Parry Visual
- **Green Circle**: Appears during 0.5s parry window
- **Gold Flash**: Perfect parry success feedback
- **Fade Animation**: Shows remaining parry window time

## Controls

### Movement
- **Arrow Keys**: 8-directional movement (only in neutral stance)
- **Smooth Movement**: Acceleration/deceleration system for responsive feel

### Combat Stances
- **A Key**: Rock stance ‚úä
- **S Key**: Paper stance ‚úã  
- **D Key**: Scissors stance ‚úåÔ∏è
- **Release**: Auto-return to neutral üë§

### Attacks
- **Space + Direction**: Dash attack in held direction

## Combat Balance by Defensive State

This section details the complete combat balance divided by the player's defensive state and action state.

### Shield Logic (With Defense Points Available)

#### Stance State (Not Dashing)
**Player in combat stance, not attacking, has defense points remaining**

**Defense Priority Order:**
1. **Defense Points Check**: Same stance as incoming attack
   - Consumes 1 defense point
   - Blocks all damage (0 damage taken)
   - Blue circle expansion visual feedback
   
2. **Perfect Parry Window**: If within 0.5s of entering stance
   - Any losing attack (enemy weaker stance) triggers perfect parry
   - 0 damage to player, enemy becomes stunned for 3 seconds
   - Gold flash and screen shake feedback
   
3. **Final Damage Resolution**:
   - Rock vs Rock: 0 damage (defense point consumed)
   - Paper vs Paper: 0 damage (defense point consumed)  
   - Scissors vs Scissors: 0 damage (defense point consumed)
   - Rock vs Scissors: Perfect parry (0 damage, stun enemy)
   - Paper vs Rock: Perfect parry (0 damage, stun enemy)
   - Scissors vs Paper: Perfect parry (0 damage, stun enemy)
   - Any vs Neutral: 1 damage (75% reduction applied)

#### Dashing State (Attacking)
**Player attacking with defense points, mutual combat scenario**

**Defense Priority Order:**
1. **Defense Points**: Not applicable (both attacking simultaneously)
2. **Perfect Parry**: Not applicable (both attacking simultaneously)
3. **Final Damage Resolution**:
   - Same stance (Rock vs Rock): 0 damage to both
   - Winning stance (Rock vs Scissors): 2 damage to enemy, 0 to player, enemy stunned
   - Losing stance (Scissors vs Rock): 0 damage to enemy, 2 to player, player stunned

### Life Logic (No Defense Points Remaining)

#### Stance State (Not Dashing)  
**Player in combat stance, not attacking, no defense points left**

**Defense Priority Order:**
1. **Defense Points Check**: Same stance as incoming attack
   - No defense points available
   - Defense fails, proceed to parry check
   
2. **Perfect Parry Window**: If within 0.5s of entering stance
   - Any losing attack (enemy weaker stance) triggers perfect parry
   - 0 damage to player, enemy becomes stunned for 3 seconds
   - Gold flash and screen shake feedback
   
3. **Final Damage Resolution**:
   - Rock vs Rock: 1 damage (balanced tie damage)
   - Paper vs Paper: 1 damage (balanced tie damage)
   - Scissors vs Scissors: 1 damage (balanced tie damage)
   - Rock vs Scissors: Perfect parry (0 damage, stun enemy)
   - Paper vs Rock: Perfect parry (0 damage, stun enemy)
   - Scissors vs Paper: Perfect parry (0 damage, stun enemy)
   - Any vs Neutral: 1 damage (75% reduction applied)

#### Dashing State (Attacking)
**Player attacking with no defense points, mutual combat scenario**

**Defense Priority Order:**
1. **Defense Points**: Not applicable (both attacking simultaneously)
2. **Perfect Parry**: Not applicable (both attacking simultaneously)  
3. **Final Damage Resolution**:
   - Same stance (Rock vs Rock): 0 damage to both
   - Winning stance (Rock vs Scissors): 2 damage to enemy, 0 to player, enemy stunned
   - Losing stance (Scissors vs Rock): 0 damage to enemy, 2 to player, player stunned

### Key Balance Differences

**Shield Logic vs Life Logic:**
- **Same Stance Defense**: Shield Logic blocks completely (0 damage), Life Logic takes tie damage (1 damage)
- **Resource Cost**: Shield Logic consumes defense points, Life Logic has no resource cost
- **Strategic Value**: Defense points provide significant tactical advantage

**Stance State vs Dashing State:**
- **Parry Window**: Only available in Stance State (not during mutual attacks)
- **Defense Points**: Only relevant in Stance State vs incoming attacks
- **Damage Scale**: Dashing State uses higher damage values (2 damage for wins) due to mutual combat risk

**Universal Rules Across All States:**
- Perfect parry always provides 0 damage + 3-second enemy stun
- Neutral stance always provides 75% damage reduction (minimum 1 damage)
- Mutual same-stance attacks always result in 0 damage to both parties
- Winning RPS matchups in mutual combat always deal 2 damage + stun loser

## Combat Balance & Testing

### Damage Balance Philosophy
- **Ties should feel like ties**: Same-stance encounters result in minimal damage
- **Defense points are valuable**: Having defense points provides significant advantage
- **Resource management matters**: Running out of defense points has consequences but not devastating

### Balance Changes Made
**v1.1 - Same-Stance Balance Fix**
- **Issue**: Same stance defense without defense points dealt 2 damage (too harsh for a "tie")
- **Fix**: Reduced to 1 damage for better balance
- **Rationale**: Rock vs Rock should never be as punishing as Rock vs Scissors

### Testing Mode Features
- **Enemy Rock-Only Mode**: `debug_rock_only = true` in Enemy.gd
- **Visual Attack Timer**: Progress bar above enemy during attack countdown
- **Purpose**: Perfect timing practice and balance testing

### Quick Reference - Damage Table

| Scenario | With Defense Points | Without Defense Points |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Same Stance (Rock vs Rock) | 0 damage, -1 defense | 1 damage |
| Winning (Rock vs Scissors) | 2 damage | 2 damage |
| Losing (Scissors vs Rock) | Perfect Parry (0 dmg + stun) | Perfect Parry (0 dmg + stun) |
| vs Neutral | 1 damage | 1 damage |
| Mutual Same Stance | 0 damage | 0 damage |
| Mutual Winner | 2 damage + stun loser | 2 damage + stun loser |

## V2 Combat Balance (Enhanced Defense System)

### Core V2 Changes

**1. Perfect Parry Enhancement**
- Perfect parry now **restores +1 defense point** (capped at maximum 3)
- Maintains original benefits: 0 damage + 3-second enemy stun
- Makes perfect parries more rewarding for resource management

**2. Weak Stance Defense Absorption**
- Defense points can now absorb damage from losing stance matchups
- Priority: Defense points absorb damage before health is affected
- Scales with available defense points (1-2 points can absorb 1-2 damage)

### V2 Combat Balance by Defensive State

#### Shield Logic V2 (With Defense Points Available)

##### Stance State (Not Dashing)
**Player in combat stance, not attacking, has defense points remaining**

**Defense Priority Order:**
1. **Same Stance Defense**: Consumes 1 defense point, blocks all damage
2. **Perfect Parry Window** (0.5s): 
   - 0 damage + stun enemy + **restore 1 defense point**
   - Any losing attack triggers perfect parry
3. **Weak Stance Defense Absorption**:
   - Rock vs Scissors (losing): Defense points absorb up to 2 damage
   - Paper vs Rock (losing): Defense points absorb up to 2 damage  
   - Scissors vs Paper (losing): Defense points absorb up to 2 damage
4. **Final Damage Resolution**:
   - With 2+ defense points vs weak stance: 0 health damage, -2 defense points
   - With 1 defense point vs weak stance: 0 health damage, -1 defense point
   - With 0 defense points vs weak stance: 2 health damage
   - Any vs Neutral: 1 health damage (75% reduction)

##### Dashing State (Attacking)
**Player attacking with defense points, mutual combat scenario**

**V2 Mechanics:**
- Defense points and parry windows not applicable (mutual attack)
- Same damage resolution as V1 (no changes to mutual combat)
- Perfect parry restoration only applies to defensive scenarios

**Damage Resolution:**
- Same stance: 0 damage to both
- Winning stance: 2 damage to enemy, 0 to player, enemy stunned
- Losing stance: 0 damage to enemy, 2 to player, player stunned

#### Life Logic V2 (No Defense Points Remaining)

##### Stance State (Not Dashing)
**Player in combat stance, not attacking, no defense points left**

**Defense Priority Order:**
1. **Same Stance Defense**: No defense points available, defense fails
2. **Perfect Parry Window** (0.5s):
   - 0 damage + stun enemy + **restore 1 defense point**
   - Provides path back to Shield Logic state
3. **Weak Stance Defense Absorption**: Not available (no defense points)
4. **Final Damage Resolution**:
   - Same stance: 1 health damage (balanced tie)
   - Weak stance: 2 health damage (full damage)
   - Any vs Neutral: 1 health damage (75% reduction)

##### Dashing State (Attacking)

- Losing stance: 0 damage to enemy, 2 to player, player stunned

### V2 Strategic Implications

**Enhanced Resource Management:**
- Defense points now provide protection against all damage types
- Perfect parries become crucial for resource sustainability
- Weak stance positions are less punishing but still costly

**Risk vs Reward Balance:**
- Perfect parry timing becomes more valuable (restores resources)
- Players can afford to be more aggressive knowing defense points absorb weak stance damage
- Resource depletion still creates meaningful tactical pressure

**Combat Flow Improvements:**
- Smoother transition between Shield Logic and Life Logic states
- Perfect parries provide comeback opportunities
- Defense points feel more valuable and strategic

### V2 Damage Comparison Tables
