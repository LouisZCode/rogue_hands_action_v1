# Game Ideas - Rogue Hands

## Core Concept
Collection of ideas for future features to avoid feature creep during current development. These are interesting concepts that could enhance gameplay but should be implemented after core systems are polished.

## Perfect Dash System
- **Concept**: "Perfect Dash" triggered when clicking attack stance + dash simultaneously
- **Potential Mechanics**: 
  - Enhanced damage multiplier (2x damage)
  - Special visual effects (trail, particles, screen flash)
  - Longer dash distance or faster dash speed
  - Piercing attacks that hit multiple enemies
  - Brief invincibility frames during perfect dash
- **Implementation Ideas**:
  - Requires precise timing window (0.1-0.2 seconds)
  - Unique audio cue for successful perfect dash
  - Different effects based on stance used (Rock = knockback, Paper = speed, Scissors = piercing)
- **Balance Considerations**:
  - Limited uses per combat encounter
  - Cooldown period after perfect dash
  - Risk/reward - harder to execute but more powerful

## Future Ideas

### Combat Enhancements

- Parry/counter-attack mechanics
- Special abilities or "power-ups"

### Visual Polish
- More particle effects for impacts
- Environment destructibility
- Dynamic lighting effects

### Game Modes
- Wave survival mode
- Arena variety with hazards
- Boss encounters with unique mechanics

### Progression
- Skill tree or upgrade system
- Unlockable stances or abilities
- Score/leaderboard system

*Note: Focus on core gameplay polish before implementing these features. Each idea should be evaluated for how it enhances the tactical Rock-Paper-Scissors combat without adding unnecessary complexity.*
