## 🤖 **NEW MODULAR AI ARCHITECTURE**

### **Core Concept**
The AI system now uses **composition over inheritance** with dedicated state classes that handle specific enemy behaviors. Each state is self-contained and follows a consistent pattern.

### **State Pattern Implementation**
```gdscript
# Old monolithic approach in Enemy.gd:
match current_state:
    AIState.WALKING:
        # 50+ lines of walking logic embedded here
        if walking_timer <= 0:
            # Complex direction picking logic
            # Boundary detection
            # Movement calculations
        # ... more embedded code

# New modular approach:
match current_state:
    AIState.WALKING:
        WalkingState.update_walking_state(self, delta)
```

### **Benefits of New Architecture**
1. **🔍 Easier Debugging**: Find WALKING issues? Check `WalkingState.gd`
2. **✏️ Easier Modification**: Want to change ALERT behavior? Edit `AlertState.gd`
3. **📖 Better Understanding**: Each state class is focused and readable
4. **🔧 Modular Testing**: Test individual behaviors in isolation
5. **🚀 Performance**: Reduced complexity and debug overhead

## 📚 **AI STATE CLASSES REFERENCE**

### **State Classes Overview**
All 10 enemy AI states have been extracted into dedicated classes:

| State Class | Purpose | Complexity | Key Functions |
|-------------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **IdleState.gd** | Standing still, 3-second duration | Low | `update_idle_state()`, `is_idle_protected()` |
| **WalkingState.gd** | Random movement, boundary detection | Medium | `update_walking_state()`, `pick_new_walking_direction()` |
| **AlertState.gd** | Brief pause before engaging player | Low | `update_alert_state()`, `start_alert_state()` |
| **ObservingState.gd** | Standing still, tracking player stance | Low | `update_observing_state()`, `observe_player()` |
| **PositioningState.gd** | Tactical movement to optimal distance | Medium | `update_positioning_state()`, `position_tactically()` |
| **StanceSelectionState.gd** | CSV-based stance probability selection | Medium | `update_stance_selection_state()`, `select_weighted_stance()` |
| **AttackingState.gd** | Dash attack execution and collision | High | `update_attacking_state()`, `perform_dash_attack()` |
| **RetreatingState.gd** | Moving away from player at 80% speed | Low | `update_retreating_state()`, `retreat_from_player()` |
| **StunnedState.gd** | Immobilized, dash cancellation | Low | `update_stunned_state()`, `prevent_dash_movement_when_stunned()` |

### **State Class Pattern**
Each state class follows this consistent pattern:
```gdscript
extends RefCounted
class_name [StateName]State

# Main update function called from Enemy.gd
static func update_[state_name]_state(enemy: Enemy, delta: float) -> void:
    # State-specific logic here

# Helper functions for state-specific behavior
static func helper_function(enemy: Enemy) -> void:
    # Additional functionality
```

---

## 🔧 **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **How to Modify AI Behavior**

#### **1. Identify the State**
Determine which AI state contains the behavior you want to modify:
- **Enemy wandering randomly?** → `WalkingState.gd`
- **Attack timing issues?** → `AttackingState.gd` 
- **Stance selection problems?** → `StanceSelectionState.gd`
- **Retreat behavior?** → `RetreatingState.gd`

#### **2. Edit the State Class**
```gdscript
# Example: Changing walking speed in WalkingState.gd
static func handle_walking_movement(enemy: Enemy, delta: float) -> void:
    # OLD: enemy.current_speed = move_toward(enemy.current_speed, target_speed, enemy.acceleration * delta)
    # NEW: Make walking faster
    enemy.current_speed = move_toward(enemy.current_speed, target_speed * 1.5, enemy.acceleration * delta)
```

#### **3. Test the Change**
- Run the game and spawn enemies (keys 1-8)
- Verify the behavior change is working
- Ensure no other behaviors are affected

#### **4. Update Constants (if needed)**
If you're changing hardcoded values, consider adding them to `GameConstants.gd`:
```gdscript
# In GameConstants.gd
const ENEMY_WALKING_SPEED_MULTIPLIER: float = 1.5

# In WalkingState.gd
enemy.current_speed = move_toward(enemy.current_speed, target_speed * GameConstants.ENEMY_WALKING_SPEED_MULTIPLIER, enemy.acceleration * delta)
```

### **Adding New AI States**
If you need to add new AI states:

1. **Create new state class** following the pattern:
```gdscript
extends RefCounted
class_name NewBehaviorState

static func update_new_behavior_state(enemy: Enemy, delta: float) -> void:
    # Your new behavior logic here
```

2. **Add to Enemy enum**:
```gdscript
enum AIState { IDLE, WALKING, LOST_PLAYER, ALERT, OBSERVING, POSITIONING, STANCE_SELECTION, ATTACKING, RETREATING, STUNNED, NEW_BEHAVIOR }
```

3. **Add to update_ai() switch**:
```gdscript
AIState.NEW_BEHAVIOR:
    NewBehaviorState.update_new_behavior_state(self, delta)
```

---

## 📊 **CSV INTEGRATION PRESERVATION**

### **How It Still Works**
The Excel→CSV→Game workflow is **completely preserved**:

1. **Excel Editing**: Edit `enemy_database.csv` in Excel as before
2. **CSV Processing**: `EnemyResourceGenerator.gd` reads CSV data unchanged  
3. **Data Loading**: `EnemyData.gd` resources contain same probability values
4. **Stance Selection**: `StanceSelectionState.select_weighted_stance()` uses CSV probabilities exactly as before

### **CSV-Driven Behavior Examples**
```gdscript
# In StanceSelectionState.gd - CSV probabilities preserved
static func select_weighted_stance(enemy: Enemy) -> Enemy.Stance:
    # Get probabilities from enemy data (from CSV)
    var total_weight = enemy.enemy_data.neutral_probability + 
                      enemy.enemy_data.rock_probability + 
                      enemy.enemy_data.paper_probability + 
                      enemy.enemy_data.scissors_probability
    
    # Same weighted selection algorithm as before
    var random_value = randf() * total_weight
    # ... rest of logic identical
```

### **What You Can Still Do**
- ✅ Edit enemy probabilities in Excel
- ✅ Add new enemy types to CSV
- ✅ Modify damage values, speeds, detection ranges
- ✅ All changes reflect in-game immediately

---

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Scenarios**

#### **"Enemy behavior changed after update"**
1. Check if you modified the correct state class
2. Verify constants in `GameConstants.gd` weren't accidentally changed
3. Look for CSV file modifications that might affect probabilities

#### **"Enemy gets stuck in one state"**
1. Check state transition logic in the relevant state class
2. Verify timer variables are being updated correctly
3. Look for missing `enemy.current_state = AIState.NEW_STATE` assignments

#### **"Stance selection not working"**
1. Check `StanceSelectionState.gd` for CSV probability reading
2. Verify `enemy_database.csv` has valid probability values
3. Ensure `EnemyData` resource is properly assigned

#### **"Combat damage is wrong"**
1. Check `CombatCalculator.gd` for damage calculation logic
2. Verify `GameConstants.gd` combat damage values
3. Look at `AttackingState.gd` for combat resolution calls

### **Where to Look**
| Problem Type | Check These Files |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Movement Issues | `WalkingState.gd`, `PositioningState.gd`, `RetreatingState.gd` |
| Combat Problems | `AttackingState.gd`, `CombatCalculator.gd`, `StanceSelectionState.gd` |
| State Transitions | Relevant state class → look for `enemy.current_state = ` assignments |
| CSV/Data Issues | `StanceSelectionState.gd`, `EnemyData.gd`, `enemy_database.csv` |
| Performance Issues | `Enemy.gd` main class, check for re-added debug code |

### **Debug Workflow**
1. **Identify the behavior**: Which AI state is misbehaving?
2. **Find the state class**: Look up the relevant `[StateName]State.gd` file
3. **Check state logic**: Read the `update_[state_name]_state()` function
4. **Verify transitions**: Look for state change assignments
5. **Test isolation**: Temporarily add debug prints to the specific state

1. ✅ Create IdleState.gd with IDLE state logic
2. ✅ Extract IDLE case from Enemy.gd update_ai() function  
3. ✅ Maintain exact same timing and animation behavior
4. ✅ Preserve idle protection mechanics for detection system

#### IdleState.gd Changes Complete:
✅ **Successfully extracted IDLE state logic:**
- **IdleState.update_idle_state()**: Complete idle behavior with deceleration, stance, and state transitions
- **IdleState.is_idle_protected()**: Checks if idle state should block detection
- **IdleState.can_be_detected_during_idle()**: Respects idle protection for detection systems
- **IdleState.was_patrolling()**: Determines if enemy was in patrolling state for alert logic
- **IdleState.should_maintain_idle_animation()**: Protects 3-second idle animation from interruption

#### Enemy.gd Updates:
✅ **IDLE case replaced**: Now calls `IdleState.update_idle_state(self, delta)`
✅ **Detection logic updated**: All idle protection checks now use IdleState functions
✅ **Animation protection**: Uses IdleState for idle animation protection
✅ **All timing preserved**: Exact same 3-second idle duration and protection mechanics

#### IDLE State Behavior (Preserve Exactly):
- Fixed 3-second idle duration for consistent animation
- Hide all indicators during idle
- Return to WALKING when timer expires
- Idle protection prevents instant detection during idle animation
